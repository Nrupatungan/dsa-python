# Example 1:
    # Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
    # Output: 6
    # Explanation:
    # 1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
    # 2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
    # Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

# Example 2:
    # Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
    # Output: 10
    # Explanation:
    # 1st customer has wealth = 6
    # 2nd customer has wealth = 10
    # 3rd customer has wealth = 8
# The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

# expected output: 17
